### 👋 Hi, I’m Olivia

Business Administration graduate with 10 years of B2B Customer Service experience, currently transitioning into Data Analytics.

I am now combining that experience with technical skills in:

Excel & Power Query  
Power BI & DAX  (PL-300 certified)
Google Looker Studio
SQL (PostgreSQL, BigQuery, SQLite)  
Applied Statistics  
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)  

This repository contains hands-on data projects focused on transforming raw data into clear, business-oriented insights.
