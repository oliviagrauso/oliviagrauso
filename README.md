### 👋 Hi there!  

I’m **Olivia**, a **Business Administration graduate** with 10 years of experience in **B2B Customer Service**, now transitioning into the **Data Analytics** field.  

I’ve always enjoyed analyzing and finding answers in numbers, but for a long time, I thought it was just an interesting part of my job.
At the end of 2024, I decided to dive deeper into this passion and start building the skills needed to become an excellent professional in the data field.  

With a strong background in **Excel**, I **expanded my skills** in **Power Query** for ETL processes and **Power BI** for creating dynamic visualizations. Then, I learned **SQL** (including dialects such as BigQuery and SQLite) to collect and connect data from various sources, and **Applied Statistics** to understand better and interpret the data I work with. I also started learning **Python** for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using libraries like **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib,** and **Seaborn**.  

Having spent a decade in Customer Service, a field that interfaces with almost every business area, I’ve developed a solid understanding of business operations and challenges. I’m now combining this experience with my analytical skills through hands-on projects that help me keep growing and improving every day.  

Let’s connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliviagrauso/)! I’m always happy to exchange ideas and learn from others in the community.
