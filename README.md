### 👋 Hi, I’m Olivia

Business Administration graduate with 10 years of B2B Customer Service experience, currently transitioning into Data Analytics.

My background in customer-facing roles has given me a strong understanding of business operations, performance metrics, and decision-making processes. I am now combining that experience with technical skills in:

Excel & Power Query
Power BI & DAX
SQL (PostgreSQL, BigQuery, SQLite)
Applied Statistics
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

This repository contains hands-on data projects focused on transforming raw data into clear, business-oriented insights.
